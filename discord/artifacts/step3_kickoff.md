# Step 3 Kickoff Pack (Live Gantt + Board Execution)

## Post 1: `#milestones-gantt`
`M-001` Weekly Update
1. Milestone ID: `M-001`
2. Planned vs actual progress: Baseline server, channel structure, bot rollout, and artifact publication in progress.
3. New risks/blockers: Bot permission asymmetry in executive channels and pin permissions.
4. Confidence change and reason: `Medium` (stable setup, minor permissions cleanup pending).
5. Next-week focus:
- finalize artifact publication and pinning policy
- convert `E-101` tasks to `Done`
- open `M-002` execution

## Post 2: `#agile-ceremonies`
Execution kickoff policy:
1. Active milestone: `M-001`
2. Active epic: `E-101`
3. Active tasks:
- `T-101` Post artifact pack to mapped channels and pin baselines where allowed.
- `T-102` Configure essential defaults for Carl-bot/sesh/MyRepoBot/Ticket Tool.
- `T-103` Run rollout checker and publish pass report in `#iteration-reviews`.
4. Board workflow: `Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> Review -> Done`
5. Every task must include:
- `M-###` and `E-###` reference
- owner
- evidence links before `Done`

## Post 3: `#team-platform-ci-board`
Create these cards:
1. `T-101 (M-001/E-101)` Post artifacts to channels and confirm publication.
2. `T-102 (M-001/E-101)` Configure non-LLM essential bot defaults.
3. `T-103 (M-001/E-101)` Run checker and publish rollout pass evidence.

## Post 4: `#planning-change-log`
Planning baseline initialized:
1. Date: `2026-02-26`
2. Baseline: `M-001..M-006`
3. Current active milestone: `M-001`
4. Reason: Establish live Gantt + Agile execution loop.
5. Linked artifacts: `milestone_gantt.md`, `agile_board_seed.md`, `work_breakdown_structure.md`
