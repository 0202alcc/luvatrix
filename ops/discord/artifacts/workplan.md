# WORKPLAN: Luvatrix Near-Term Execution Plan

## 1) Planning Horizon
Current horizon: next 6-10 weeks.

## 2) Strategic Objective
Stabilize and harden current Phase 1 runtime while preparing clean interfaces for future platform expansion.

## 3) Primary Deliverables
1. Vulkan stabilization and fallback parity improvements.
2. Finalized app protocol and variant-routing docs.
3. CI hardening with deterministic gates and guarded GUI smoke visibility.
4. Operational collaboration system (Discord + artifacts + bot baseline).

## 4) Constraints
1. Single human operator currently (CEO) with AI-assisted throughput.
2. Need strong context retention across project switching.
3. Must preserve safety, auditability, and deterministic quality gates.

## 5) Resource Model (Current)
1. CEO: strategy, approvals, prioritization, final integration decisions.
2. AI agents: drafting, implementation support, quality/reporting support.
3. Non-LLM bots: operations automation (workflow, release signals, incidents, moderation).

## 6) Execution Model
1. Hybrid Gantt + Agile:
- Gantt controls milestone-level sequence and dependency risk.
- Team Agile boards control task-level execution.
2. Milestone linkage policy:
- each epic/task references `M-###`.

## 7) Immediate Actions
1. Finalize and pin baseline artifacts in Discord.
2. Complete non-LLM bot baseline config.
3. Start milestone planning baseline (`M-001` onward).
4. Begin first execution cycle with weekly review cadence.

## 8) Exit Criteria for This Workplan Cycle
1. Baseline artifacts approved and live in channels.
2. At least one milestone decomposed to executable board items.
3. Decision log and risk register active with current entries.
4. Weekly executive digest running consistently.
